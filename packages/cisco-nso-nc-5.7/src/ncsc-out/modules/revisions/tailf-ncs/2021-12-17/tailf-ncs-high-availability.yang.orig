    description
      "Released as part of NCS-5.7.

       Non-backwards-compatible changes have been introduced.

       Added /high-availability/read-only action to enable/disable read-only
       mode.

       Added /high-availability/status/read-only-mode config false leaf
       to show whether read-only mode is enabled/disabled.

       Added /high-availability/settings/consensus/{enabled,algorithm}
       config true leafs to allow algorithms to reach consensus of one
       active master at any time.

       Added constraint under /high-availability/settings/enable-failover.

       Changed default value to 'true' for
       /high-availability/settings/reconnect-slaves";
