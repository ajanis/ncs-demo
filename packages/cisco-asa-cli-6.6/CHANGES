cisco-asa v6.6.10 [2019-07-19]
=============================

General:

    Look for 'API CHANGE' below to see what changes have been made that may
    not be backwards compatible.

Enhancements:

  - Added remove-before-change in console/server_group leaf in
     aaa authentication ssh|telnet|http|enable|serial
     aaa accounting enable|ssh|telnet|serial
    (ASA-298 / RT38178)

cisco-asa v6.6.9 [2019-06-14]
=============================

General:

    Look for 'API CHANGE' below to see what changes have been made that may
    not be backwards compatible.

Enhancements:

  - Lowered SCP upload chunk size from 16384 to 8192 to reduce the chance of
     read-timeout on slow SCP connections.

Corrections:

  - Updated NEDCOM to version 1.81.
     Contains a fix for a turbo parser filtering issue (with list keys
     containing both '/' and ':') which could cause out of sync issues
     when doing commit no-overwrite.
    (ASA-296)


cisco-asa v6.6.8 [2019-06-07]
=============================

General:

    Look for 'API CHANGE' below to see what changes have been made that may
    not be backwards compatible.

Enhancements:

  - Removed all ned-data annotations in the YANG model.
    They are deprecated and not used by any NSO version supported by this NED.
    Consequently, support for NSO 4.2 and 4.3 is now technically discontinued.
    (ASA-295)

  - Improved and future-proofed progress reports for the upcoming NSO
     Maapi.reportDeviceProgress method.
    (ASA-294)

  - Added 'write serialize-maapi-acl-read true|false' ned-setting in order to
     be able to serialize access-list Maapi read from CDB. This may temporarily
     overcome an issue with poor NSO performance if multiple devices read from
     the CDB at the same time.
    (ASA-290)

  - Lowered SCP upload chunk size from 32768 to 16384 to reduce the chance of
     read-timeout on slow SCP connections.

Corrections:


cisco-asa v6.6.7 [2019-06-03]
=============================

General:

    Look for 'API CHANGE' below to see what changes have been made that may
    not be backwards compatible.

Enhancements:

Corrections:

  - Do not specify user id in Maapi.attach or nacm may deny reading admin
     device config.
    (ASA-293 / RT37642)


cisco-asa v6.6.6 [2019-05-17]
=============================

General:

    Look for 'API CHANGE' below to see what changes have been made that may
    not be backwards compatible.

Enhancements:

  - Added "auto" enum option to extended-parser ned-setting and changed
     default from "disabled" to "auto" to make input parsing more robust.
    (ASA-289)

  - Do not write login passwords in the NED trace with log-verbose true.
    (ASA-288)

  - Replaced NedSecrets NAVU code with CdbSession.getObjects for improved
     performance and replacement of a deprecated API.
    (ASA-288)

  - Statically disabled upgrade code of ned-settings (from v5.x -> v6.x) due
     to performance reasons. Set ENABLED to true in UpgradeNedSettings.java
     and recompile if needed.
    (ASA-287)

  - Show config mode in ApplyException when a config command fails on device.
    (ASA-286)

  - Trace initial NSO data in prepareDry with log-verbose before modifications.
    (ASA-290)

Corrections:

  - Fixed problem with turbo-mode dropping "no arp permit-nonconnected" line.
    (ASA-289)


cisco-asa v6.6.5 [2019-04-26]
=============================

General:

    Look for 'API CHANGE' below to see what changes have been made that may
    not be backwards compatible.

Enhancements:

  - Upgraded nedcom.jar to release-1.76, improving read timeout Exception
     output (time, input buffer + patterns waiting for).
    (ASA-285)

  - Check 'developer simulate-command' ned-setting list in live-status exec
     any <command>.
    (ASA-284 / RT37198)

Corrections:


cisco-asa v6.6.4 [2019-04-12]
=============================

General:

    Look for 'API CHANGE' below to see what changes have been made that may
    not be backwards compatible.

Enhancements:

  - Added support for NSO 5.1 config CLI command 'load-native-config' which
     can be used to load and convert device config into ncs_cli config mode:
     admin@ncs(config)# devices device <device> load-native-config data|file
    Note: Even with netsim the data is parsed as it was in native IOS format.
    (ASA-282)

  - Added support for new NSO 5.1 'verbose' flag to sync-from CLI command,
     printing additional info like unknown commands etc. in the CLI.
    (ASA-282)

  - Upgraded nedcom.jar to release-1.73.

Corrections:


cisco-asa v6.6.3 [2019-03-28]
=============================

General:

    Look for 'API CHANGE' below to see what changes have been made that may
    not be backwards compatible.

Enhancements:

  - Added new ned-setting to enable progress reports in potentially time
     consuming code in order to get a better overview of time spent. The
     first Verbosity.NORMAL progress reports implemented in the NED are:
      - modifying output - prepare[-dry] phase
      - sending config   - prepare phase
      - reading config   - initialize|get-trans-id|show phases
      - extended parsing - show phase
      - reconnecting     - prepare|commit|keepalive phases
     Set 'cisco-asa developer progress-verbosity' ned-setting to enable.
     Notes:
      - NED progress reports are not supported in all NSO versions.
      - NED progress is not shown in 'commit | details <verbosity level>'
         yet due to NSO limitations. File a ticket if needed.
    (ASA-281)

  - Improved rebuilding of NED since the pyang to yanger change (ASA-272)

Corrections:


cisco-asa v6.6.2 [2019-03-14]
=============================

General:

    Look for 'API CHANGE' below to see what changes have been made that may
    not be backwards compatible.

Enhancements:

  - Further improved access-list performance in PREPARE[-DRY] by disabling
     access-list rule debug tracing if not enabled (see new ned-setting).
    (ASA-279)

  - Added new developer ned-setting 'trace-level' and moved some traceVerbose
     calls to traceDebug2 and traceDebug3 level to save time and trace size.
    (ASA-278)

Corrections:

  - Fixed delete dependency problem, correct order is:
     object-group network * / no network-object *
     no object network *
    (ASA-277)

  - Do not warn if access-list does not exist in CDB.


cisco-asa v6.6.1 [2019-03-07]
=============================

General:

    Look for 'API CHANGE' below to see what changes have been made that may
    not be backwards compatible.

Enhancements:

  - Improved access-list performance in PREPARE[-DRY] when reading list
     from CDB by replacing NAVU code with Maapi.getObjects().
    (ASA-276 / RT36576)

  - Updated NEDCOM to version 1.67.

Corrections:


cisco-asa v6.6 [2019-03-01]
===========================

General:

    Look for 'API CHANGE' below to see what changes have been made that may
    not be backwards compatible.

Enhancements:

  - Do not call 'configure session' to detect whether the device supports
     session mode, this will avoid populating the trace with ERROR.
     Instead, disable session mode if the device does not support it.
     Check the trace for 'config-session-mode' for status.
    (ASA-273)

  - Switched from pyang to yanger with turbo mode parser.
    Rebuilding from source code is now limited to within same NSO branch.
    (ASA-272, ASA-274)

  - Silently ignore, instead of log, empty lines as suspicious archive files.
    (ASA-272)

  - Improved config false live-status performance by:
     - Added support for new NSO live-status API - showStatsPath
     - Added run-after-show:false option to if:interfaces-state/interface list
    (ASA-269)

  - API CHANGE:
     Removed 'cisco-asa deprecated connection legacy-mode' ned-setting
      and the legacy connect code.
    (ASA-268)

  - Updated NEDCOM to version 1.66.

Corrections:

  - Added back "interfaces" container and "interfaces-ref" type in
     local copy of ietf-interfaces.yang file.
    Warning: NSO will interpret "interfaces" container as config false
             even though it is not.
    (ASA-269)


cisco-asa v6.5.6 [2018-12-21]
=============================

General:

    Look for 'API CHANGE' below to see what changes have been made that may
    not be backwards compatible.

Enhancements:

Corrections:

  - Restored auto 'noprompts' flag for live-status packet-tracer command.
    (ASA-263)


cisco-asa v6.5.5 [2018-11-30]
=============================

General:

    Look for 'API CHANGE' below to see what changes have been made that may
    not be backwards compatible.

Enhancements:

  - Do not default to group 1 if fail to lookup failover group in user context
     config on admin device 'context{<name>}/join-failover-group'.
     Instead, throw an Exception and optionally fallback to CLI if enabled.
    (ASA261)

  - 'scp-transfer device-lookup true' optimization:
      When looking up the device for secondary failover groups, also check that
      the Secondary admin interface does not list as Failed (e.g. due to cable
      being disconnected). If lists as Failed, then do not use SCP at all.
    (ASA260 / RT35523)

Corrections:


cisco-asa v6.5.4 [2018-11-16]
=============================

General:

    Look for 'API CHANGE' below to see what changes have been made that may
    not be backwards compatible.

Enhancements:

  - Honor 'write slow-newline-delay' ned-setting in live-status actions.
    (ASA-258)

Corrections:

  - Removed unused tailf-cisco-asa-oper.yang file.


cisco-asa v6.5.3 [2018-11-13]
=============================

General:

    Look for 'API CHANGE' below to see what changes have been made that may
    not be backwards compatible.

Enhancements:

Corrections:

  - Do not move ssh timeout value inside context modification.
    (ASA-256 / RT35324)


cisco-asa v6.5.2 [2018-11-02]
=============================

General:

    Look for 'API CHANGE' below to see what changes have been made that may
    not be backwards compatible.

Enhancements:

Corrections:

  - Added default and report-all default mode to ssh key-exchange group.
    Strip group name and value when deleting.
    (ASA-255 / RT35177)


cisco-asa v6.5.1 [2018-10-25]
=============================

General:

    Look for 'API CHANGE' below to see what changes have been made that may
    not be backwards compatible.

Enhancements:

  - Throw a 'incomplete command' Exception insteaf of a 'internal deadlock
     error' Exception when NSO tries to delete an empty access-list. NSO
     should not have been able to configure this empty access-list. The CDB
     can be cleaned by issuing a sync-from to remove the erronous access-list.
    Note: Malformed line will still be shown in commit dry-run.
    (ASA-254 / RT35133)

  - Added 'write slow-newline-delay' ned-setting to be able to specify the
     number of milliseconds the NED should pause before sending newline when
     writing the following slow commands to the NED:
      - copy to running-config
      - show/more running-config
      - session commit noconfirm
      - write memory
     The reason to delay sending newline is to trick the ASA CLI to allow
      the command to complete regardless of the ssh timeout value.
    (ASA-253)

  - Reconnect to CLI session after SCP upload on admin session in case the
     server side closed the CLI due to inactivity. Note: This can normally be
     prevented using the 'scp-transfer cli-keepalive-interval' ned-setting.
    (ASA-252)

  - If 'ssh timeout' value is raised and using SCP, configure the new value
     using CLI before uploading the remainder with SCP in order to be able
     to use the new timeout value in this transaction.
    (ASA-251)

Corrections:

  - Fixed %i substitution in config archive file name.
    (ASA-250 / RT35070)


cisco-asa v6.5 [2018-10-22]
===========================

General:

    Look for 'API CHANGE' below to see what changes have been made that may
    not be backwards compatible.

Enhancements:

  - Upgraded nedcom.jar to release-1.46, prepared for NSO 5.0 with CDM support.
    (ASA-249)

  - Switch to use NEDCOM reconnector, enabling support for TELNET reconnect
     in e.g. commit, keepAlive as well as SSH.
    (ASA-247)

  - Support for using name umap lookup in authgroup settings when using
     SCP or SCP to admin-device.
    (ASA-241)

  - Restrict allocated name to disallow base interface names, both
     in system context allocate-interface and in user context allocated
     list.
    (ASA-227 / RT34694)

Corrections:

  - Added numerous missing dependencies to interface/allocated, used for
     multi-contexts.
    (ASA-248 / RT35051)


cisco-asa v6.4.2 [2018-10-19]
=============================

General:

    Look for 'API CHANGE' below to see what changes have been made that may
    not be backwards compatible.

Enhancements:

  - Send a newline before the SCP copy to running-config in order to update
     the ASA devices session timeout, which is only updated after a command.
    (ASA-244 / RT35004)

Corrections:

  - Moved SSH reconnect code in doApply to after the SCP upload in order to
     reconnect before the scp-transfer cli-fallback mode tries to upload via
     CLI, which could by then have timed out.
    (ASA-243 / RT34799)

  - Fixed a minor issue with keepAlive where it did not immediately return
     success after a reconnect. The subsequent call would return true though.
    (ASA-243 / RT34799)


cisco-asa v6.4.1 [2018-10-17]
=============================

General:

    Look for 'API CHANGE' below to see what changes have been made that may
    not be backwards compatible.

Enhancements:

  - Added 'scp-transfer device-lookup' ned-setting. Set if you want to use an
     additional SSH session to lookup which device secondary failover group
     contexts are running on. Typically this is not needed, since the NED will
     fallback to try the other device if SCP transfer fails on its first choice.
     NOTICE: Setting this setting will slow down all group 2 SCP transfers,
             but reduce the worst-case transfer time for corner cases.
             See ASA-329 ticket note below for information on those.
    (ASA-246)

  - Switched to use device write-timeout setting for the following operations:
     #1 Using SCP: copy /noconfirm <file> running-config
     #2 Using sessions: commit noconfirm
     #3 All actions, i.e. live-status exec any <command> and config exec <command>
     #4 Config Archiving
    (ASA-244 / RT35004)

  - show, getTransId, applyConfig, prepareDry, revert and abort methods now all
     begin with setting timeout to read-timeout to override the NSO value.
    (ASA-244 / RT35004)

  - Added support for reconnecting using NewSSHSession if remote SSH server
     closed the session due to inactivity in the following methods:
      #1 commit
      #2 keepAlive
      #3 applyConfig, commit and revert (after transform but before sending)
    Note: Although working, this solution is temporary and will be replaced
          when the NSO NED API supports a reconnect using standard methods.
    (ASA-243 / RT34799)

Corrections:

  - Fixed bug in offline prepareDry timeout reset which set timeout too short.
    (ASA-244 / RT35004)


cisco-asa v6.4 [2018-10-15]
===========================

General:

    Look for 'API CHANGE' below to see what changes have been made that may
    not be backwards compatible.

Enhancements:

  - Added 'scp-transfer cli-fallback' ned-setting. If enabled, the NED will
     fallback to use CLI to read/write data if current SCP transfer fails.
     Hence, SCP will always be tried first, even if failed in the past.
    (ASA-242)

  - Added 'scp-transfer device2-address' ned-setting to use with active/active
     failover setup with user mode contexts. NED will auto-detect if the context
     belongs to secondary failover group and is Active on Secondary and then use
     this address instead of the device-name address to SCP to/from. Port and
     login credentials for device2 are inherited from scp-transfer/device-name.
    (ASA-239)

  - SCP code used with active/active failover group 2 will fallback and use the
     other physical device IP if initial upload/download fails due to connection
     failure or upload to wrong physical device. For most cases it will deduce
     the correct device first, but in worst case (#3 group 1 and 2 on PHY B)
     and (#4 group 2 on PHY A and group 1 on PHY B) it will pick the wrong
     device first and the SCP transfer may take twice as long. Both these cases
     should be temporary since they have in common that both devices are up and
     running. The system is either manually (mis)configured to run like this,
     or the contexts have not switched over yet but will soon.
    (ASA-239)

  - Added 'scp-transfer cli-keepalive-interval' used to specify interval in
     seconds when the SCP upload code should 'ping' the user context SSH
     session to keep it from timing out during a time consuming SCP upload
     using a second SSH session to admin-device.
    (ASA-239)

  - Removed 'scp-transfer read-timeout' ned-setting. It is no longer needed
     because the NED will auto reset timeouts during SCP upload and download.
    (ASA-239)

  - Updated NEDCOM to version 1.45.

Corrections:


cisco-asa v6.3.1 [2018-10-12]
=============================

General:

    Look for 'API CHANGE' below to see what changes have been made that may
    not be backwards compatible.

Enhancements:

  - Reset timeout if less than half left insteaf of less than 20% as before.
    (ASA-238)

  - Throw Exception before SCP transfer if copy to/from temporary file failed.
    (ASA-237)

  - Added 'scp-transfer read-timeout' ned-setting in order to temporarily
     raise the device read-timeout when downloading via SCP. Upload timeout
     uses normal read-timeout and is continuously reset automatically.
    (ASA-236)

  - Added support for %c in scp-transfer/directory. %c will be replaced by
     the directory part in context config-url, including the ending /.
    (ASA-235)

Corrections:

  - Fixed problem with enable password and pbkdf2 secret.
    (ASA-231 / RT34814)


cisco-asa v6.3 [2018-10-09]
===========================

General:

    Look for 'API CHANGE' below to see what changes have been made that may
    not be backwards compatible.

Enhancements:

  - Added support for SCP transfer when reading running-configuration.
     Set 'read scp-transfer method enabled' and configure scp-transfer
     ned-settings.
    (ASA-234)

Corrections:

  - Added workaround for NSO bug which surfaced in v6.2.3 where prepareDry
     could reset timeout to 0 if called in offline mode, i.e. initNoConnect.
    (ASA-233 / RT34834)

  - API CHANGE:
     Moved all ned-settings from 'write scp-transfer' to 'scp-transfer' except
      'threshold' due to the addition of SCP support while reading config as
      well and they should share the same SCP information.
    (ASA-222 / RT34609)


cisco-asa v6.2.3 [2018-10-06]
=============================

General:

    Look for 'API CHANGE' below to see what changes have been made that may
    not be backwards compatible.

Enhancements:

  - Reset NSO read-timeout in APPLY-CONFIG transformations in order to be able
     to keep a low timeout even though extensive access-list data.
    (ASA-233 / RT34834)

  - Improved error output if no response from device in bulk sending mode.
    (ASA-232 / RT34843)

  - Added support for pbkdf2 in username and enable passwords.
    (ASA-231 / RT34814)

  - Additions to the YANG model:
     asp rule-engine transactional-commit access-group
     asp rule-engine transactional-commit nat
    (ASA-230 / RT34810)

  - Updated NEDCOM to version 1.43.

Corrections:

  - Fixed problems with secrets for admin user on multi mode device.
    (ASA-231 / RT34814)

  - Throw error on SCP transfer when copy commit config to running config
     returns "Command not valid".
    (ASA-231 / RT34814)


cisco-asa v6.2.2 [2018-09-30]
=============================

General:

    Look for 'API CHANGE' below to see what changes have been made that may
    not be backwards compatible.

Enhancements:

  - Rewrote SCPSession implementation to improve performance by parallelization.
    (ASA-222 / RT34609)

Corrections:

  - Fixed SCP connection close issue leaving stale connections on server.
    Fixed two harmless Exceptions when failing to open SCP connection.
    (ASA-222 / RT34609)


cisco-asa v6.2.1 [2018-09-29]
=============================

General:

    Look for 'API CHANGE' below to see what changes have been made that may
    not be backwards compatible.

Enhancements:

  - The NED package now contains folder with third party licences.
    (ASA-200)

  - config-archive improvements:
     Archive even if 'write memory-setting' is set to disabled.
     Also issue a 'dir' command on standby device in order to honor max files.
    (ASA-224 / RT34628)

  - Implemented a set of new ned-settings to be able transfer config to
    device using SCP. For user contexts, the admin-device is used to transfer
    the config since it is not possible to do it via user context in ASA.
    To enable:

      (1) Enable SCP copy on device:
           asa5545-adm(config)# ssh scopy enable
      (2) Set 'write scp-transfer threshold' ned-setting to e.g. '0'.
      (3) Check and optionally modify ned-settings in 'write scp-transfer'

      If configured for a user context on a multi-mode device, also:

      (4) Set 'context name' ned-setting to user context name.
      (5) Create private directory on device in system mode:
           asa5545-adm# mkdir /noconfirm disk0:/contexts
      (6) Config 'storage-url private disk0:/contexts disk0'
          in each context config in system mode.
      (7) Set 'write scp-transfer directory' ned-setting to "disk0:/contexts/"
      (8) Set 'write scp-transfer device-name' ned-setting to admin-device name

      Example config for a user mode context:

       devices device asa5545-ctx ned-settings cisco-asa write scp-transfer threshold 0
       devices device asa5545-ctx ned-settings cisco-asa write scp-transfer directory "disk0:/contexts/"
       devices device asa5545-ctx ned-settings cisco-asa write scp-transfer max-sessions 1
       devices device asa5545-ctx ned-settings cisco-asa write scp-transfer number-of-retries 60
       devices device asa5545-ctx ned-settings cisco-asa write scp-transfer device-name asa5545-adm

cisco-asa v6.2 [2018-09-21]
===========================

General:

    Look for 'API CHANGE' below to see what changes have been made that may
    not be backwards compatible.

Enhancements:

  - Major rewrite of live-status action handling, adding support for
     passing one-shot auto-prompts list entries and built-in answer
     keywords <ignore>, <prompt>, <exit> and <timeout> for improved
     device output parsing flexibility. See README for details.
    (ASA-225)

  - Added built-in archive support, executed when NED saves config.
    See 'ned-settings cisco-asa write config-archive' list description
     for details.

cisco-asa v6.0.13 [2018-08-31]
==============================

General:

    Look for 'API CHANGE' below to see what changes have been made that may
    not be backwards compatible.

    WARNING:
    When using cisco-asa with other NEDs, certain combinations of NED versions
    may cause 'random' Exceptions. The reason for this is the introduction of
    a new common NED component - nedcom.jar - which initially was located in
    shared-jar, but later moved to private-jar. However, since the JAVA loader
    looks in shared-jar directories first, a newer NED with nedcom.jar in
    private-jar will still load another NED's older nedcom.jar in shared-jar;
    causing a version conflict and quite possibly an Exception.

    Hence, if you are using a newer NED (with private-jar/nedcom.jar) you must
    make sure no other NEDs in your project has a shared-jar/nedcom.jar. If they
    do, you must upgrade them to a version which also has nedcom in private-jar.

    The following NED versions have their nedcom.jar in shared-jar:

    a10-acos      3.6.5
    alu-sr        6.0.2 to 6.1.1
    cisco-asa     5.2 to to 5.2.1
    cisco-ios     5.2.8 to 5.4.2
    cisco-iosxr   6.0 to 6.1
    cisco-nx      4.4.7 to 4.5.2
    huawei-vrp    4.2.6

    In short, avoid the above NED versions when using other NEDs.

Enhancements:

  - Added support for automatic decryption of $8 maaapi encrypted passwords
     when sending password(s) to the device.

===========================

Enhancements:

  - New major release due to ned-settings API CHANGE.

  - API CHANGE:
     Due to NED standardisation, moved the YANG path to all ned-settings
     not residing under cisco-asa container.
     Notice: 'cisco-asa context list * hide-configuration' changed from
             type empty to type boolean due to lack of support for type
             empty in new NedSettings implementation in NEDCOM.
     The path changes should be intuitive, but if not, see README.
     Upgrade code in UpgradeNedSettings.java updates to new paths in CDB.
    (ASA-187)

Corrections:

  - Replaced hard-coded profile name "cisco-asa" with devices device
     <devname> device-profile name.
    (ASA-186 / RT33002)

  - Fixed delete order dependency, correct order is:
     no tunnel-group * general-attributes / authorization-server-group
     no aaa-server *
    (ASA-185 / RT32990)

  - Fixed problem with live-status exec command and exit prompting for
     multiple device prompts.
    (ASA-185 / RT32990)


cisco-asa v5.10.6 [2018-04-27]
==============================

Enhancements:

  - Additions to the YANG model:
     context * / storage-url
    (ASA-181)

Corrections:

  - Do not throw exception for uninitialized contexts in show/compare.


cisco-asa v5.10.5 [2018-04-20]
==============================

Enhancements:

  - Additions to the YANG model:
     crypto ca trustpoint * / enrollment url
     crypto ca trustpoint * / serial-number
    (ASA-176 / RT32625)

  - Additions to the YANG model:
     access-list * log default
     ipv6 icmp * deny|permit *
     interface * / ipv6 address * standby
     logging message * level
     policy-map * / class * / inspect pptp
     policy-map * / class * / inspect icmp error
     xlate per-session *
    (ASA-175 / RT32708)

Corrections:

  - API CHANGE:
     object-group icmp-type * / group-object *
     object-group network * / group-object *
     object-group service * / group-object *
     object-group user * / group-object *
      changed from leaf to list-syntax leaf-list to support multiple entries.
    (ASA-180 / RT32886)

  - Throw error on "not available" from device when commiting config.
    (ASA-179 / RT32849)

==============================

Enhancements:

  - Support for SSH/TELNET proxy login configuration.
     Set huawei-vrp proxy under ned-settings to enable and configure.
     Also see src/metadata/README for connection info.
    (ASA-177)

  -  Changed default connect code to used the new NEDCOM Connector.
     The NED connection steps are configured in JSON connection templates,
     from now on called connectors. The connectors work in combination
     with connection ned-settings (such as those located in 'connection'
     or 'proxy' containers) to specify the prompts, commands and states
     required to connect, allowing for flexible connect configuration.
     If for some reason the old connect is required, enable it with the
     'deprecated connection legacy-mode' ned-setting.
     See src/metadata/README for more information.
     New ned-settings (see standard README):
      cisco-asa connection connector
    (ASA-170, ASA-171)

     with access-list modifications.
    (ASA-167 / RT32597)


cisco-asa v5.10.1 [2018-03-22]
==============================

Enhancements:

  - Optimized access-list commit performance for !insert after comment.
    Added debug performance profiling info in applyConfig() method to log
     the time spent in modifying config.
    Reset timeout in applyConfig() after modifying the config to account for
     the time spent transforming, decreasing chances of timeout.
     The timeout value used is max of read-timeout and connect-timeout.
    (ASA-162)

  - Changed apply-device-config-settings number-of-lines-to-send-in-chunk
     ned-setting default from 100 to 32 to avoid buffer overflow on device.
    (ASA-162)

  - SonarQube inspection and fixes to achieve 0 Bugs and Vulnerabilities.
    Removed old ned-id upgrade code.
    (ASA-160)

  - Additions to the YANG model:

============================

Enhancements:

  - Switched NedSecrets implementation from private to new NEDCOM NedSecrets.
    (ASA-158)

  - Adapted cisco-asa NED Java class to the latest NED base class features in
     NEDCOM. The NED and NEDCOM now built with Java source/target version 1.7.
    (ASA-157)

  - Only insert device command in output of live-status action if multiple
     commands are executed by use of " ; ".

Corrections:

  - API CHANGE:
     Due to standardisation, moved the YANG path to the following ned-settings:
      cisco-asa-log-verbose -> cisco-asa log-verbose
    (ASA-157)


cisco-asa v5.9.3 [2018-03-09]
=============================

Enhancements:

  - Additions to the YANG model:
     sysopt radius ignore-secret
    (ASA-153 / RT32157)

Corrections:


cisco-asa v5.9.2 [2018-03-06]
=============================

Enhancements:

  - Additions to the YANG model:
     no sysopt connection permit-vpn
     no sysopt connection reclassify-vpn
     sysopt traffic detailed-statistics
    (ASA-153 / RT32157)

Corrections:

  - Enabled support for "login" keyword in access-list entry.
    (ASA-155, ASA-156 / RT32250)


cisco-asa v5.9.1 [2018-03-02]
=============================

Enhancements:

  - Additions to the YANG model:
     aaa-server * / dynamic-authorization
     aaa-server * / interim-accounting-update
     aaa-server * / max-failed-attempts
    (ASA-154 / RT32166)

  - Additions to the YANG model:
     sysopt connection timewait
    (ASA-153 / RT32157)

Corrections:

  - API CHANGE:
     sysopt connection tcpmss minimum
      Due to bad modelling not allowing a value.
    (ASA-153 / RT32157)


cisco-asa v5.9 [2018-02-23]
===========================

Enhancements:

  - Added 'cisco-asa apply-device-config-settings compress-acl-delete'
     ned-setting to control delete of entire access-lists. With this setting
     set to true, the entire access-list is deleted using a single command
     (clear config access-list <name>). If left at its default, each access-list
     entry is deleted individually when deleting the entire access-list.
    WARNING:
     When using this ned-setting and switching between standard and extended
     access-list entries with the same name the device may end up in a bad state
     not allowing creation of an access-list entry of different type, i.e.
      asav-1(config)# clear config access-list ACL2
      asav-1(config)# access-list ACL2 standard permit any4
      ERROR: Cannot mix different types of access lists
     The only work around we found (so far) is to reboot the device and either
     disable the use of this ned-setting, or do not reuse the same name for
     access-lists with different type.
    (ASA-152 / RT32054)

  - Commit performance optimization:
     Added apply-device-config-settings number-of-lines-to-send-in-chunk
     ned-setting in order to be able to send certain config in larger chunks
     instead of line by line. A higher number normally results in better
     performance but may have a negative impact on the error handling.
     If you get an 'Internal ERROR: retry-command', set this
     setting to 1 and report the config line which triggered the exception.
     Default is 100 lines per chunk.
    (ASA-151 / RT32022)

Corrections:


cisco-asa v5.8.4 [2018-02-16]
=============================

Enhancements:

  - Additions to the YANG model:
     access-list * time-range
     time-range *
    (ASA-148 / RT31923)

- Additions to the YANG model:
     group-policy * attributes / banner value
     webvpn / hostscan
    (ASA-144 / RT31703)

Corrections:

  - Fixed aaa delete order dependency, correct order is:
     no aaa accounting *
     no aaa-server *
    (ASA-149 / RT31925)

  - Fixed logging delete order dependency, correct order is:
     no logging trap
     no logging list *
    (ASA-147 / RT31899)


cisco-asa v5.8.3 [2018-02-08]
=============================

Enhancements:

Corrections:

  - Dont throw exception on missing startup-config file in context when
     trying to show config using more. Save running and continue.
    (ASA-146)


cisco-asa v5.8.2 [2018-02-02]
=============================

Enhancements:

  - Additions to the YANG model:
     class *
     class * / limit-resource *
     mac-address auto prefix
     ssh scopy enable
    (ASA-145 / RT31771)

  - Additions to the YANG model:
     dynamic-access-policy-record * / user-message
    (ASA-144 / RT31703)

  - Support for port names in object network * / nat * service tcp|udp
    (ASA-140 / RT31543)

Corrections:

  - API CHANGE:
     tls-proxy maximum-sessions -> tls-proxy maximum-session
    (ASA-145 / RT31771)

  - Fixed access-list delete order dependency, correct order is:
     no access-list *
     no object-group *
    (ASA-143 / RT31702)

  - Fixed access-list insert code bug when access-list modifications were split
     by dependencies.
    (ASA-143 / RT31702)

  - Do not add "log disable" when deleting context access-lists.
    (ASA-140 / RT31543)


cisco-asa v5.8.1 [2018-01-05]
=============================

Enhancements:

  - Additions to the YANG model:
     as-path access-list *
    (ASA-139)

  - Support for commiting during Configuration Replication. Command is
     retried after waiting for 'End Configuration Replication to mate'.
    (ASA-138)

  - Additions to the YANG model:
     aaa-server * host * / server-type
     aaa-server * host * / ldap-base-dn

     aaa-server * host * / ldap-attribute-map
     ldap attribute-map * / map-name *
     ldap attribute-map * / map-value *
    (ASA-137 / RT31255)

Corrections:


cisco-asa v5.8 [2017-12-21]
===========================

Enhancements:

  - Rewrote 'cisco-asa admin-device method ssh*' ned-setting to reuse a pool
     of SSH admin connections by means of a synchronized Multiton class.
    Implemented a new ned-setting 'cisco-asa admin-device max-sessions' to
     configure maximum number of admin SSH connections per admin-device.
    Note: The actual amount will be 1 higher if the admin-device is also
     communicating directly.
    Note: Set the admin-device max-sessions ned-setting, not the contexts.
    (ASA-136)

  - Added a semaphore around 'cisco-asa admin-device method maapi' code using
     the new 'cisco-asa admin-device max-sessions' net-setting to limit usage
     of SSH connections due to creation of multiple admin-device NED instances.
    (ASA-136)

  - Additions to the YANG model:
     bgp-community new-format
    (ASA-134)

Corrections:

  - Fixed support for device encrypted secret in:
     username * attributes / ssh authentication publickey
    (ASA-135)

=============================

Enhancements:

  - Additions to the YANG model:
     logging class *
     logging list * class
     logging mail
     logging permit-hostdown
     ssh cipher integrity
     ssl server-version
     ssl client-version
    (ASA-133 / RT30894)

Corrections:


cisco-asa v5.7.2 [2017-11-22]
=============================

Enhancements:

  - Added ordered-by user on cisco-asa-context-list ned-setting list.
    (ASA-130)

  - Append [[2..N]] to duplicate remarks when reading access-lists from device,
     e.g. [[2]] for first duplicate remark. Strip [[N]] from CDB access-list
     remark when writing to device to avoid diff. Note: if you delete a
     duplicate remark in NSO, you will have to renumber the remaining duplicates
     to avoid a compare-config diff since the following duplicate remarks will
     be renumbered when read from device.
    (ASA-129 / RT30802)

  - Additions to the YANG model:
     arp rate-limit
     crypto ca trustpool policy / auto-import
     ssh cipher encryption custom
     track * rtr
     username * attributes / ssh authentication publickey
    (ASA-128)

  - Additions to the YANG model:
     object service * / service icmp [type] [code]
    (ASA-126 / RT30720)

  - use-startup-config ned-setting changes:
     Removed check in commit for unsaved config changes (v5.6.1, ASA-118)
     Removed warning notice in prepareDry (v5.6.1, ASA-118)
     Auto-save config in show() (sync-from and compare-config) if running
      config differs vs saved config (determined by checksum comparison).
    (ASA-124 / RT30494)

Corrections:

  - Make sure object-group is not empty when replacing network-object.
    (ASA-127 / RT30757)


cisco-asa v5.7.1 [2017-11-10]
=============================

Enhancements:

  - Additions to the YANG model:
     sla monitor * / num-packets
     sla monitor * / tos
     sla monitor * / timeout
    (ASA-125)

  - Ignore malformed obu comment from NSO (an !insert using non-existing rule)
    (ASA-123)

  - Throw an exception if ned-setting cisco-asa-context-name is set for multi
     mode login with admin context, i.e. capable of switching contexts. Reason
     being cisco-asa-context-name setting is for single context logins only.
     If you need to restrict contexts for admin device, use the context-list
     ned-setting, specifying the contexts which should be allowed.
    (ASA-122 / RT30404)

  - Added optional 'hide-configuration' leaf to cisco-asa-context-list in order
     to specify context(s) where only the context definition is of interest, i.e.
     the context configuration under "changeto context <name>" is not included
     in the sync-from / compare-config.
    (ASA-122 / RT30404)

Corrections:


cisco-asa v5.7 [2017-10-20]
===========================

Enhancements:

  - Rewrote hard coded live-status code to use the NedLiveStatus.java class.
    Added live-status inventory to show serial numbers.
    Removed demo live-status inside-interface. Use new interfaces-state.
    (ASA-121)

  - Replaced internal debug command 'show fixed-config' with 'sync-from-file'
    The internal live-status exec any sync-from-file command is used to inject
    a config file in NETSIM. The next 1 sync-from will sync-from this file.
    For example:
      admin@ncs# devices device netsim-0 live-status exec any "sync-from-file
         /home/myuser/cisco-test-config.yxy"
      admin@ncs# devices device netsim-0 sync-from
    (ASA-120)

  - Added generic software support for showPartial(), enabling support for
     'commit no-overwrite' and 'partial-sync-from'.
    (ASA-119)

  - Support for running multiple commands in 'live-status exec any' and config
     mode 'exec' commands. Use the delimiter " ; " (note: must be white spaces)
     to separate each command. If need to answer prompts, supply them separatedly
     for each command, e.g.:
       exec "command 1 | prompts Y ; command 2 | prompts N"
     Warning: No error checking is done on command output, i.e. this command
              is 100% raw, you must check the errors yourself. Only exception
              (of course) is that config command may not leave config mode.
    (ASA-117)

  - Added live-status interfaces-state for basic RFC7223 ietf-interfaces.yang
     and RFC7277 ietf-ip.yang operational support.
    See the YANG files for YANG model and ASANedCli.java nedLiveStatusRegister()
     method for regular expressions scraping the info from show commands.
    (ASA-106)

Corrections:


cisco-asa v5.6.2 [2017-10-17]
=============================

Enhancements:

  - Added 'ssh-resuse' cisco-asa admin-device method. Same as 'ssh' except that
     the SSH connection is kept open for the duration of the NED session.

Corrections:

  - Only perform the save check in applyConfig and not abort and revert.
    (ASA-110 / RT30127)


cisco-asa v5.6.1 [2017-10-13]
=============================

Enhancements:

  - Throw an exception in commit with cisco-asa get-device-config-settings
     use-startup-config ned-setting if device has unsaved config, i.e a
     checksum diff between startup-config and running-config. To solve this
     in NSO, save the device by use of 'do devices device <devname> live-status
     exec any "write memory"'; and then commit again.
    (ASA-118)

  - Added ms timestamps for performance profiling. Grep for DONE in trace.

Corrections:

  - Do not fallback to show config using 'show startup-config' if first method
     fails to get saved-config. Reason being if we do, we will fail to remove
     leftover config in a failed commit.
    (ASA-110 / RT30127)


cisco-asa v5.6 [2017-10-11]
===========================

Enhancements:

  - Implemented support for using 'configuration session' when editing
     access-list, object-group and object. See ASA documentations for details.
     Enable by setting cisco-asa apply-device-config-settings config-session-mode.
    (ASA-111)

  - Additions to the YANG model:
     forward-reference enable
     object service *
    (ASA-111)

  - Save only modified contexts, as opposed to the old behaviour where all
     contexts were saved using the write memory all command.
     Note: if the old behaviour is preferred, set cisco-asa-write-memory-setting
     to the new setting 'on-commit-all'.
    (ASA-101)

Corrections:

  - Fixed order dependency between:
     object *
     object-group *
    (ASA-111)


cisco-asa v5.5.4 [2017-10-06]
=============================

Enhancements:

Corrections:

  - Fixed transaction id problem with secrets and show-checksum option.
    (ASA-116)

  - Redisable terminal pager in exec mode if pager configured in config mode.
    (ASA-115 / RT30210)

  - Fixed problem with NED deadlocking and timing out if empty access-list
     erronously configured.
    (ASA-115 / RT30210)

  - Don't fail when debugging JVM inside Eclipse.
    (RT30198)


cisco-asa v5.5.3 [2017-10-05]
=============================

Enhancements:

Corrections:

  - Fixed problem with service-policy config causing order dependency issues
     with policy-map vs class-map and access-list vs object-group.
    (ASA-112, RT30143, ASA-113 / RT30167)

  - Do not throw an exception if config is not saved with use-startup-config
     in order to avoid a recently (v5.3.3) introduced problem where a failed
     transaction did not rollback properly.
    (ASA-110 / RT30127)

  - Fixed order dependency between:
     access-list *
     object-group *
    (ASA-109 / RT30113)

  - Send 'changeto system' when leaving 'changeto context' context in order
     to be able to continue modify system config in same transaction.


cisco-asa v5.5.2 [2017-09-21]
=============================

Enhancements:

Corrections:

  - Fixed maapi exception in close.
    (ASA-96 / RT29853, ASA-105)


cisco-asa v5.5.1 [2017-09-20]
=============================

Enhancements:

  - Removed cli-show-no on:
     interface * / nameif
     interface * / security-level
      Note: if an interface is created with these leaves set, a fix will be
            needed to clear them.
    (ASA-107 / RT29975)

Corrections:

  - Restored trimming of commands sent to device (broken in v5.5).
    (ASA-107 / RT29975)


cisco-asa v5.5 [2017-09-18]
===========================

Enhancements:

  - Added support for commit dry-run without connecting to device.
    (ASA-105)

  - Additions to the YANG model:
     interface * / management-only
     policy-map * / class * / set connection advanced-options <tcp-map>
     policy-map * / parameters / tcp-inspection
     timeout igp stale-route
    (ASA-104 / RT29935)

  - Rewrote the access-list code from scratch to:
     - No longer use a show command on device to read the old list
     - Be more liberate in accepting diffset from NSO; by ignoring already
       existing access-list entries, except for updating the insert index.
     - Show what the NED will send to the device in commit dry-run.
    (ASA-102 / RT29895, ASA-103)

  - Additions to the YANG model:
     vpn load-balancing / cluster port

Corrections:

     interface * / ip address
    (ASA-98 / RT29863)


cisco-asa v5.4 [2017-09-13]
===========================

Enhancements:

  - Inject delete of context disk file in transaction when context is deleted
     or when context config-url is (re)set and new ned-setting cisco-asa auto
     context-config-url-file-delete is set to true (default). Hence in this case
     all config must come from NSO and not a pre-existing context config file.
    (ASA-99 / RT29864)

  - Added support for "?" in 'live-status exec any' and 'config exec' commands
     in order to be able to show help menus.
    (ASA-95)

  - Added a new optional method to calculate transaction id:
     cisco-asa-transaction-id-method config-hash-cached
      Same as config-hash except that transaction id method will reuse
      the last unmodified config from show (sync-from).
    (ASA-93)

Corrections:

  - Restored devices device platform data broken for some NSO versions
     in cisco-asa v5.3.2.
    (ASA-100)

  - Removed ordered-by user from two lists:
     object-group service * / service-object *
     object-group service * / port-object *
    (ASA-99 / RT29864)

  - API CHANGE:
     loopback-proxy server
     loopback-proxy client syslog
     arp permit-nonconnected
      Changed from cli-show-no type empty leaf to cli-boolean-no type boolean
      leaf to avoid sending down unsupported config to new context.
    (ASA-99 / RT29864)

  - Corrected badly placed cli-show-no on pager lines to assure that
     'no pager lines' is sent down on a newly created context.
    (ASA-99 / RT29864)

  - Fixed compare-config diff and problem setting 'enable password'.
    Removed erronous support for enable password with level.
    (ASA-97 / RT29860)

  - Fixed two problems with long banners:
     Bad dequoting of string causing lost characters.
     NED was blocked on ^H characters generated in echo for long strings.
    (ASA-96 / RT29853)


cisco-asa v5.3.3 [2017-09-08]
=============================

Enhancements:

  - Removed the cisco-asa admin-device reuse ned-setting and
    introduced a new ned-setting; cisco-asa admin-device method
     which is used to configure which method should be used to pull
     the context config from an admin device.
    (ASA-84 / RT29248)

  - Added cisco-asa admin-device number-of-retries and
     cisco-asa admin-device time-between-retry ned-settings to
     enable retrying if admin SSH connect fails.
    (ASA-84 / RT29248)

Corrections:

  - Cleaned up and fix banner exec issue.


cisco-asa v5.3.2 [2017-09-01]
=============================

Enhancements:

  - Additions to the YANG model:
     devices device platform serial-number
      Note: Only supported by newer NSO versions.
    (ASA-91)

Corrections:

  - API CHANGE:
     policy-map * / class * / set connection timeout idle
      Changed time leaf type from hhmm-type to string with pattern.
    (ASA-90 / RT29679)

  - API CHANGE
     icmp *
      Combined deny and permit lists to a single ordered-by user list.
      NOTE: Since the list is ordered per interface, the command ordering
            had to be changed to: icmp <nameif> <rule>. NED will swap order
            to device order when writing and reading.
    (ASA-88 / RT29546)


cisco-asa v5.3.1 [August 18, 2017]

cisco-asa v5.3 [August 11, 2017]
==================================

Enhancements:

  - Additions to the YANG model:
     timeout conn-holddown
    (ASA-87 / RT29451)

  - API CHANGE:
     Changed admin-device ned-setting config from specific info to just the
     name of the admin device. Hence new connection example looks like this:
      devices device asa5545-ctx ned-settings cisco-asa admin-device name asa5545-adm
    (ASA-84 / RT29248)

  - Do not open admin-device SSH connection until needed, i.e. reading config.
    Close admin-device SSH connection immediately after use, unless the new
     ned-setting cisco-asa admin-device reuse is set to true.
    (ASA-84 / RT29248)

Corrections:

  - Moved nedcom.jar from shared-jar to private-jar directory.


cisco-asa v5.2.1 [August 04, 2017]
==================================

Enhancements:

Corrections:

  - Do not cache worker in utility classes since worker may change.
    (ASA-86)


cisco-asa v5.2 [July 28, 2017]
==============================

Enhancements:

  - Additions to the YANG model:
     flow-export active refresh-interval
     flow-export delay flow-create
     flow-export destination *
     flow-export template timeout-rate
     policy-map * / class * / flow-export event-type * destination *
    (ASA-85 / RT29249)

  - Implemented 'cisco-asa get-device-config-settings use-startup-config'
    ned-setting in order to force the NED to retrieve startup-config only, i.e.
    saved config. This can be used to avoid a race condition when a 2nd connection
    is used to retrieve config, which occurs if the latest transaction was not
    saved yet.
    (ASA-83 / RT29234)

  - Added new feature for optimizing sync-from (and compare-config).
    Enable with ned-setting 'cisco-asa extended-parser turbo-mode'.
    (ASA-81)

Corrections:

  - Close secondary admin connection/session in close method.
    (ASA-84 / RT29248)


cisco-asa v5.1.1 [June 24, 2017]

     context * / join-failover-group
     failover group * / primary|secondary
     failover group * / preempt
    (ASA-82 / RT28808)

Corrections:

  - Use config-url from context config to specify file containing running-config.
    (ASA-77 / RT28639)


cisco-asa v5.1 [June 15, 2017]
==============================

Enhancements:

  - Additions to the YANG model:
     crypto dynamic-map * set reverse-route
     crypto map * set ikev1 transform-set
     crypto isakmp identity
     webvpn / cache / disable
    (ASA-80 / RT28750)

  - Read device-profile from devices device <devname> device-profile.
    Default to cisco-asa.
    (ASA-78)

  - Implemented support for a secondary (admin) connection with single context
    logins on multiple-mode devices (i.e. using cisco-asa-context-name). The
    admin connection (must use SSH) is used to list configuration using the
    more command from system context, thereby also showing cleartext passwords.
    Example of how to configure a connection to an admin connection:
     devices device asa5545-ctx ned-settings cisco-asa admin-device address 1.2.3.4
     devices device asa5545-ctx ned-settings cisco-asa admin-device port 22
     devices device asa5545-ctx ned-settings cisco-asa admin-device remote-name cisco
     devices device asa5545-ctx ned-settings cisco-asa admin-device remote-password cisco
     devices device asa5545-ctx ned-settings cisco-asa admin-device remote-secondary-password cisco
    WARNING: Running-config must be saved or more command will not be used, i.e
             make sure to have cisco-asa-write-memory-setting set to on-commit.
    (ASA-77 / RT28639)

Corrections:

  - API CHANGE:
     webvpn / error-recovery disable
      Changed from enum to boolean leaf to support 'no error-recovery disable'
    (ASA-80 / RT28750)

  - Fixed bug with "snmp-server group|host" and Nedsecrets.
    (ASA-79)


cisco-asa v5.0.8 [May 19, 2017]
===============================

Enhancements:

Corrections:

  - Restored support for reordering access-lists on NETSIM.
    Uses to-transaction, hence introduced the need for ned-data.

==============================

Enhancements:

  - Additions to the YANG model:
     policy-map * / class * / set connection random-sequence-number

     timeout * sctp
    (ASA-73 / RT27864)

Corrections:

  - Removed order-by user on object-group network * / network-object list to
     avoid ending up with empty list while modiyfing it.
    Added object-group/network tailf:cli-diff-dependency on nat list.
    (ASA-72)

  - Strip meta-data prefix in NedSecrets if shown, to avoid bad regexp.
    Fixed problem with TACACS+ key secret by escaping + in key name(s).


cisco-asa v5.0.5 [March 31, 2017]
=================================

Enhancements:

  - Additions to the YANG model:
     object network * / nat * service tcp|udp
    (ASA-71 / RT27662)

  - Additions to the YANG model:
     aaa accounting serial console
    (ASA-70)

Corrections:


cisco-asa v5.0.4 [March 20, 2017]
=================================

Enhancements:

  - Added "| noprompts" option to live-status exec commands in order to be able
     to ignore (erronously) triggered question prompts. Also added 'IGNORE' as
     an option to '| prompts' in order to specify what prompts to ignore.

    (ASA-63)

Corrections:

  - Fixed problem with error detection mechanism matching command echo by
     increasing the match echo line length from 50 to 500. NOTE: terminal
     width must always be set to 511 in day 0 (See README).
    (ASA-63)


cisco-asa v5.0 [December 22, 2016]
==================================

Enhancements:

  - Rewrote the implementation for supporting device encrypted data in order
     to support commit queues.

    of out of sync or config diff due to the reverse transaction failing too.

  - Improved performance for modifying access-list by reducing the
     number of show run access-list calls to the device.
    (ASA-45 / RT25014)

  - access-list improvements:

cisco-asa v4.1.1 [June 16, 2016]
================================

Enhancements:

  - Removed config commands 'crypto key' and 'crypto ca import'.
    Use 'exec' commands which supports all config commands as well as
    context and input-string options.

  - Implemented cisco-asa-auto-prompts ned-setting which can be used to
    register standard answers to standard questions. For example:
    devices global-settings ned-settings cisco-asa-auto-prompts Q1 question
      "System configuration has been modified" answer "no"

  - Additions to the YANG model:
     crypto map * set security-association lifetime kilobytes
     failover lan unit
     interface * / mac-address
     object network * / fqdn
     snmp-server host-group *
     sysopt connection preserve-vpn-flows
     terminal width
     tunnel-group * ipsec-attributes / ikev2 remote-authentication pre-shared-key
    (RT23334)

Corrections:

  - Removed "terminal width 511" config line in login code since it breaks
    show-checksum cisco-asa-transaction-id-method. Make sure the terminal
    width is set to maximum in device config.


cisco-asa v4.1 [June 2, 2016]
=============================

Enhancements:

  - Additions to the YANG model:
     password encryption aes
   (RT22672)

  - Implemented support for replacing encrypted device secrets with the
    cleartext cdb value in order to avoid compare-config diff and out of
    sync with service. The new design requires support for tailf:meta-data
    which means the minimum NCS/NSO versions had to be raised accordingly.
    All transformed secrets on the device should now be supported.
   (RT22672)

  - Added support for passing answers to prompts in live-status exec and
    config exec commands. Append '| prompts <answer1> [answer2]' to command.
    Note: For hitting enter only on a prompt, add the prompt key 'ENTER'
    Note: Single character replies are sent without LF.
    Examples:
     admin@ncs(config-config)# exec "crypto key generate rsa label LENNART | prompts yes"

  - Additions to the YANG model:
     interface * / policy-route route-map
    (RT21203)

Corrections:

     modify changes on active sla monitor, requring temporary delete of
     sla monitor schedule.
    (RT22176)

  - API CHANGE:
     object network * / nat
    Changed from multi-word-key to specific in order to support dependencies.
    (RT23244)

    Example of how to specify the single context 'FOO':
    devices device <devname> ned-settings cisco-asa-context-name FOO
    (RT22791)

  - Use 'more disk0:/<context>.cfg file if multi-context admin and context
    config is saved in order to show pre-shared secrets in cleartext.

  - Added 'any' exec command and optional context name under live-status
    to be able to execute any ASA command in any context on the device.
    For example:
    devices device <devname> live-status exec any context FOO "show ver"
    NOTE: Only works if logged in as multi-context admin.

  - Added support for all config exec commands under 'exec'. For example,
    to run a command in config mode, type: 'exec clear configure dns'.
    Also added support for optional context change prior to running the
    command, e.g.: 'exec context FOO clear configure dns'

  - Additions to the YANG model:
     interface * / ospf message-digest-key *
     interface * / ospf authentication
    (RT22671)

    devices device 5545 ned-settings cisco-asa-write-memory-setting disabled


Corrections:

  - Added object[-group]/network dependency on access-list rule.

  - Fixed problem with access-list ordering and contexts.
    (RT21899)
