cisco-ios v3.0.0.1 [Feb 28, 2017]
=================================

Corrections:

  - Fixed so we compile for java 1.6

cisco-nx v3.0 [Februari 28, 2014]
=================================

This release is function wise equivalent to the previous release, which was 1.0.
The only difference is that this NED now is maintained using
a new product life-cycle which is independent of the NCS release life-cycle.

The version number 3.0 has been chosen to indicate a common baseline for
all NEDs, which is higher than any previous NED version.

For this NED no upgrades are necessary.

The Tail-f package: cisco-nx NED was initially imported 2014-02-25
